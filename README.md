RxJava â€“ Reactive Extensions for Java

RxJava is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences in Java. It enables you to handle data streams, transformations, and concurrency in a clean, declarative way.

ðŸ“Œ Why Use RxJava?

Asynchronous & Event-driven â€“ Easily manage data streams, network calls, UI events, etc.

Declarative â€“ Define what should happen, not how to do it step-by-step.

Composable â€“ Combine multiple asynchronous operations seamlessly.

Thread Management â€“ Effortlessly switch between background and main threads.

Error Handling â€“ Built-in operators for managing errors.
