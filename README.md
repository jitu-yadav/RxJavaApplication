RxJava â€“ Reactive Extensions for Java

RxJava is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences in Java. It enables you to handle data streams, transformations, and concurrency in a clean, declarative way.

ðŸ“Œ Why Use RxJava?

Asynchronous & Event-driven â€“ Easily manage data streams, network calls, UI events, etc.

Declarative â€“ Define what should happen, not how to do it step-by-step.

Composable â€“ Combine multiple asynchronous operations seamlessly.

Thread Management â€“ Effortlessly switch between background and main threads.

Error Handling â€“ Built-in operators for managing errors.

Best Practices

Always manage Disposables (e.g., CompositeDisposable in Android).

Keep transformations pure (no side effects in operators).

Avoid doing heavy work on the main thread.

Use the right Scheduler for the job.
